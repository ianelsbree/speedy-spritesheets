# Speedy Spritesheets

A simple tool for making animation sprite sheets out of image sequences.
This tool uses a GUI interface to allow artists to easily generate spritesheets. They can be generated from image
sequences that have been exported from an animation too, to then be used in video games or other applications where
animations can be loaded through spritesheets.

Currently, Speedy Spritesheets can only import and export PNG images, and exports a variable-width, single-row,
horizontal spritesheet, but both of these are planned to be expanded upon soon.

See the changelog [here](CHANGELOG.md).
