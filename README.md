# Speedy Spritesheets

A simple tool for making animation sprite sheets out of image sequences.
The plan for this project is to use a GUI interface to allow artists to easily generate spritesheets. They will be generated from image sequences that have been exported from an animation tool, to then be used in video games or other applications where animations can be loaded through spritesheets.
